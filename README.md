# Hi there! 👋 I'm Ekemini Thompson

**Machine Learning Engineer • Generative AI • Multimodal Systems • Ethical AI**  
*PhD Candidate in Computer Science*

Passionate about building production-ready AI systems that solve real-world problems in **healthcare**, **aviation**, and **scientific discovery**. Experienced in fine-tuning LLMs (Llama-3, GPT-family), multimodal models (text + vision), and secure MLOps pipelines. Currently pursuing a PhD while publishing research and contributing to open-source AI initiatives.

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On
- **Generative & Multimodal AI** projects (vision-language models, scientific data captioning)
- **Healthcare AI** (predictive diagnostics, EMR systems, brain disease detection)
- **Aviation & Safety-Critical AI** (fitness-to-fly certification, domain-adapted LLMs)
- Open-source contributions (Hugging Face, VergelAI, ethical AI tools)
- Research collaborations leading to publications

## 🚀 Current Highlights
- Fine-tuned **Llama-3-8B** for aviation question-answering → **+38% factuality** (2025 preprint)
- Built production multimodal chatbot for scientific text + image processing
- Deployed healthcare models achieving **92–95%** accuracy in diabetes & brain disease prediction
- Mentored junior engineers and taught ML to 200+ students
